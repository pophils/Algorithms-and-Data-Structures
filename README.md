# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
Repository contains implementation of the basic data structures and some random algorithms. The random algorithms provides  solution to some of the reinforcement/Creativity/Project problems found in Data Structures and Algorithms in Python (http://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275) alongside any other problems that comes to mind while studying the book.
All codes are implemented in Python 3.*
